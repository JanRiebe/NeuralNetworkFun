# NeuralNetworkFun
This is my first attempt to create neural networks.
The idea of the project is to writa a framework that can create, train, save and load neural networks and learn about them.

For now the program will have a command line interface and store networks in xml files.

I'm writing this project in C#, using Visual Studio.
